# Python Project 

## Description

In this project i basically tried to automate the word search solving process on an online website using selenium library 

## Data structure (Trie)
As whenever we have to optimize our search when we have billions of input data we have to be fast . Providing a bruteforce solution
will work but is inefficient in terms of time complexity and we don't want our users/client to be inproductive in any ways.

So Trie will provide functionalities of searching, inserting, building words efficiently in this project .

We basically have a grid so i first build a trie using all the words provided to us to match them in the grid. And then
i ran my solve function to generate those matching pattern ):

## Commands to run this project

  in terminal type 
  1. pip install selenium
  2. python word_search_solver.py
